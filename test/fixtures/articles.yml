  title: "In Defense of Robert Rubin"
  description: "Seldom does a Sunday pass of late without Frank Rich, the New
  York Times columnist, taking a potshot at Robert Rubin. This past week he
  took two. But I've been having a hard time understanding what Rich and
  others who are angry at Rubin are angry about. Sometimes they claim he
  blocked financial regulation when he served in the Clinton administration.
  Sometimes they blame him for not preventing the troubles at Citigroup.
  Sometimes they argue that he has too many disciples in the Obama
  administration, or that he was overpaid, or—the dominant theme lately—that
  he's not sorry enough for whatever it is he may have done wrong."
